# SoulEdit
Customized character editor for use with our game engine on Unity

User requirements: This is an in-house editor designed for developer use. Few safeguards exist to prevent user error; this editor assumes familiarity from the designer whom is using it.

To use this tool, run 'hitboxeditor.jar' from the main directory.

Sample script files are included in the directory '/samplescripts'

Developer Requirements.

This was written in Java 5, using the ogre4j library. This library was only ever written in 32 bit when in development, so a 32 bit version of java is required. 

Due to incompatibility issues with Java 8, Java version 7 ***must be used.***
